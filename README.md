## GoMotivated

Application that shows a random quote, stored in redis. No frameworks were used on purpose, as this was supposed to be a learning excercise

## TODO
- Fix go get in docker file
- Write a proper readme with installation and usage instructions
- Unit tests
- Redis to have persistence
- Docker compose file that bootstraps redis (now it assumes it is already setup)
- Docker compose file that bootstraps the frontend too (now it assumes it is already setup)
